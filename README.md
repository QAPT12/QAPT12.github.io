This web page is going to be used as a sort of "portfolio".</br></br>
To build this page I used a few different resources, along with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</br>
Resources used includes:
1. [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for pre built JavaScript and HTML Elements, this has been a favorite of mine for a while now.
2. [FontAwesome's](https://fontawesome.com/) free kit. For all icons needs FontAwesome is the place I go first, especially with their offering of free to use icons
